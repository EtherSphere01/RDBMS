### Anomalies

- Three types of main `anomalies`

### Functional Dependency

- Functional dependency in simple terms means that the value of one attribute (or set of attributes) uniquely determines the value of another attribute(s) in a database table.

```
X ---> Y

X = DeterMinant
Y = Dependant

X , Y will be functionally dependent when,\

t1.X = t2.X
then, t1,y = t2.y
```
